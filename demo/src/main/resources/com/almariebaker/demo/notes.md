# Java FX

## Classes

- Stage: think of the stage as the whole window. If you want a multi-window application, you will need multiple stages.
- Scene: think of the scene as the content of the window. You can change the scene of a stage to change what is displayed.
- Parent: a node that can have children. This is the root of the scene graph.
- Node: the base class for all JavaFX nodes. This is the superclass for all UI elements.
